# Planetary Pressure-adjusted Human Development Index 2022 Analysis

## **Brief Overview:**

The Planetary Pressure-adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI) was developed by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to complement the Human Development Index analysis. It adjusts the HDI according to the planetary pressures produced by each country. To assess the planetary pressure, an adjustment factor is calculated based on the arithmetic mean of the indices for carbon dioxide emissions per person (production-based) and material footprint per capita. The PHDI is finally computed as the product between HDI and the adjustment factor. 

To explore the PHDI in more detail, including methodology, you can visit the [UNDP website](https://hdr.undp.org/planetary-pressures-adjusted-human-development-index#/indicies/PHDI).

The difference in rank between the HDI and PHDI are calculated to reveal insights that could lead to societal and structural transformations. 

The focus of the current analysis was to compare the PHDI to the **Gross National Income (GNI) per capita** (constant 2017 PPP$) - in other words, to compare the planetary pressure levels to the wealth of a country.

## **Key Concepts:**

+	**The Gross National Income (GNI) per capita** (constant 2017 PPP$) describes the average income per person in a country in a year, adjusted for inflation and differences in cost of living across countries based on the year 2017.

+ **Carbon dioxide emissions (production) index** is the index for CO2 emissions per capita (production-based). It utilizes a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 76.61 tonnes per capita. Higher index values indicates less planetary pressure.

+ **Material footprint index** is the index for Material footprint per capita.The minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is of 140.82 tonnes per capita. Higher index values indicates less planetary pressure.

The most recent HDI calculated is of the year 2022 and the open access data can be assessed at the [UNDP website](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/documentation-and-downloads).

## **Main questions:**

To understand how PHDI related to GNI, I asked two primary questions:

+ Are wealthier countries polluting the most?
+ If so, does the group of wealthiest countries ranked lower in the PHDI rank than in the HDI rank? 

For the analysis, I used the UNDP’s classification of countries into four groups:

+ Very High Human Development
+ High Human Development
+ Medium Human Development 
+ Low Human Development

## **Results:**

Multiple data-driven insights came from this analysis. Regarding to the two central questions:

+ Wealthier countries tend to pollute more. 

+ In average, countries classified as Very High Human Development rank lower in PHDI compared to HDI, due to their higher levels of pressure on the planet.

Other relevant observations:

+ Countries classified as Very High Human Development exhibited the biggest difference between their HDI rank and the PHDI rank among groups (SD = 27.50). 

+ Countries belonging to the Very High Human Development group had the greatest variability in their PHDI levels - followed by the group of High Human Development countries.

+ Inference: greater economic wealth does not necessarily translate into sustainable development. 

The exact reasons for the increased pressure on the planet led by wealthier countries might include:

+ Some of those countries - such as United States, Canada, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirate, Kuwait, China and Russia - are the main fossil fuel producers in the world. Therefore, their lower Carbon Dioxide Emissions (production) Index contribute to their decline in the PHDI rank position [(Global Energy Review, 2025)](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2025).

+ Countries such as Ireland, Singapore, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Finland and Norway rank lower in the PHDI rank because of their high Material Footprint Index. The Material Footprint reflects the amount of raw materials extracted worldwide to meet the consumption demands of a specific country. Therefore, the *consumption* pattern in those countries is overall unsustainable [(European Environmental Agency, 2023)](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators/europes-material-footprint). 

*To note:* countries scoring low in the CO₂ emissions Index might also score low in the Material Footprint index. 

## Key Conclusions:

+ **Wealthier countries tend to exert higher planetary pressure**

The data suggest a positive correlation between Gross National Income (GNI) per capita and environmental pressure as reflected in lower PHDI scores relative to HDI.

+ **Very High Human Development countries are most affected in the PHDI ranking**

On average, these countries rank significantly lower in the PHDI compared to HDI, due to high carbon emissions and material consumption.

This group also shows the greatest variability in PHDI scores, suggesting varying environmental performance among wealthy nations.

+ **Two main contributors to planetary pressure:**

1. CO₂ emissions (production-based): Fossil fuel producers (e.g., US, Canada, Russia, Saudi Arabia) score low on the CO₂ emissions index.

2. Material footprint: High-income consumption-based economies (e.g., Luxembourg, Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland) have high material footprints due to their elevated resource use and import-heavy economies.

## Recommendations:

+ Wealthier countries need to transform their consumption-based societies. High levels of consumerism in a linear economy lead to environmental pressure that will translate into climate change. 
  + It is necessary to prioritize healthier and sustainable purchasing habits plus to introduce circular economy practices to different industry sectors.
  
+ The dependence on fossil fuels must be decreased through the expansion of sustainable energy sources, such as wind, solar and ocean energy. 
  + This expansion needs to account for the public and environmental impact in their origin countries and it needs to align with global policies ensuring fair trade and social equity support.

+ The PHDI should be the core metric when evaluating the development of a country. Our relationship to the environment is vital for a long-term and sustainable development of the planet and its societies.
